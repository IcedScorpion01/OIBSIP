# Basic Login Authentication System

This project implements a basic login authentication system using Java Swing. The system allows users to register, login, and access a secured page. 

# Project Overview

The system is designed to accomplish the following functionalities:

    User Registration: Users can register by providing a username and password. The system securely stores user information and hashed passwords.

    Password Encryption: Passwords are securely hashed and salted before storage to enhance security.

    User Login: Registered users can log in by entering their username and password. The system verifies the entered password against the stored hashed password.

    Secured Page: Authenticated users can access a secured page that displays a message.

# How to Use

    Run the Application: Compile and run the LoginAuthenticationSystem.java file to launch the application.

    Login: Enter your username and password and click the "Login" button. If the credentials are correct, you'll see a "Login successful!" message.

    Register: To register a new user, enter a new username and password and click the "Register" button. If the username is unique, you'll see a "Registration successful!" message.

# Important Note

    In this example, an in-memory database is used to store user information. In a real-world scenario, a proper database should be used.
    Passwords are stored as plain text for simplicity. In a production system, passwords should be securely hashed and salted using dedicated cryptographic libraries.

# Code Structure

    LoginAuthenticationSystem.java: The main application file that sets up the GUI and handles user registration and login logic.
